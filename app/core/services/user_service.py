    - Avatar updates create a new avatar record and associate it with the user.
    - Role changes validate that the new role is a valid assignable role.
    - Blocking/unblocking users checks current status to prevent redundant operations.
    - User filtering by username/email is case-insensitive and excludes admin users.
    - Contact messages are checked for duplicate titles before creation.
    - Follow/unfollow operations check for existing relationships to prevent duplicates or errors.
    - When retrieving followers/following, full user profiles are returned for display purposes.
