    Service class for album management business logic.

    Business rules enforced in this service:
    - Album names must be non-empty and max 50 characters.
    - Users cannot have multiple albums with the same name (case-insensitive).
    - Only album creators (or admins) can rename or delete albums.
        - Deleting an album also deletes all associated photos (handled by DB cascade).
        - When renaming, the new name must also pass validation and uniqueness checks.
        - Favorite albums are retrieved with their names for display purposes.
